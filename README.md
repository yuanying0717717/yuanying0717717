## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Yuanying Qu, a student at the University of Liverpool.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on research related to human kinematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence, especially in the acoustic detection and classification of human postures.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning advanced techniques in deep-learning-based human motion analysis to improve the accuracy of my research further.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that combine human motion studies with AI-driven healthcare applications or other fields where acoustic analysis of human movements can provide valuable insights.
- ðŸ¤” I'm optimizing the algorithms for real-time human posture detection in complex environments.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my research in human kinematics, computer science-related topics such as data mining and big data analysis, or my teaching experiences in various programming languages and engineering courses.
